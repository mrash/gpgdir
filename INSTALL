Installation notes:

QUICK AND EASY INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Just run the gpgdir installation script "install.pl" from the gpgdir
sources directory:


# ./install.pl

Note that you need to be root since gpgdir will need to install the
GnuPG and Term::ReadKey perl modules in /usr/lib/gpgdir.  Gpgdir makes
use of perl modules from this directory so as to not pollute perl
modules that are installed in the system perl lib tree.
