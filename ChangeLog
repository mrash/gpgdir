gpgdir-0.9.9 (09/07/2006):
    - Added RPM .spec file to build gpgdir as an RPM.
    - Added the --Skip-mod-install command line argument to install.pl to
      allow all perl module installs to be skipped.
    - Added the --force-mod-regex command line argument to install.pl to allow
      a regex match on perl module names to force matching modules to be
      installed.
    - Updated to TermReadKey-2.30 from 2.21.

gpgdir-0.9.8 (07/03/2006):
    - Updated to use GnuPG::Interface instead of GnuPG module.  This should
      fix the incompatibility issues seen between the GnuPG module and some
      GnuPG installations.
    - Added perl module installation code from fwknop (see
      http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/).  This allows gpgdir to
      preferentially use any perl modules that are already be installed on the
      system.

gpgdir-0.9.4 (10/12/2005):
    - Updated test mode to encrypt and decrypt a testing file within the
      directory to be encrypted or decrypted.  This file is located at
      <dir>/gpgdir_test, and is removed after the test is completed.
    - Bugfix for "protocol error: expected SHM_GET_XXX got GOOD_PASSPHRASE"
      error in GnuPG module.

gpgdir-0.9.3 (02/20/2005):
    - Added --Include and --Include-from options to allow inclusion
      regular expressions to be specified.
    - Bugfix for not decrypting filesnames that contain spaces.

gpgdir-0.9.2 (01/05/2005):
    - Added preservation of file mtime and atime values (may be disabled
      with the --no-preserve-times option).
    - Added testing encryption and decryption of dummy file (may be
      disabled with --skip-test) by default for both encrypt and decrypt
      modes.
    - Added --test-mode to run encrypt -> decrypt test and exit.
    - Removed unnecessary compression options.
    - Updated get_homedir() to reference HOME environmental variable if
      the /etc/passwd file does not exist (OS X being a good example).
    - Added --verbose mode.
    - Updated output to generate errors on a per-file basis instead of
      dumping them at the end of an encrypt/decrypt operation.

gpgdir-0.9.1 (11/11/2004):
    - Updated GnuPG.pm perl module to handle return code of PLAINTEXT
      which seems to be returned by GunPG now (as of version 1.2.6)
      instead of DECRYPTION_OKAY upon a successful decryption.

gpgdir-0.9 (09/12/2004):
    - Added --gnupg-dir option to allow a user to specify a different
      user's .gnupg directory for encryption keys.
    - Switched to "[+]" (and related) message prefixes.

gpgdir-0.8 (05/29/2004):
    - Added --Exclude and --Exclude-from options to allow files to be
      excluded based on regex matches.
    - Reworked error messages so they contain the filename associated
      with each error.

gpgdir-0.4 (04/23/2004):
    - Added --pw-file option so that a decryption password can be
      read out of a file.
    - Better directory validation (filesystem -e and -d checks).
    - Added INSTALL file.
    - Updated man page and README file.

gpgdir-0.3 (09/27/2003):
    - Bundled perl modules GnuPG and TermReadKey with gpgdir.
    - Modified install.pl and gpgdir to install and use GnuPG and
      TermReadKey modules from the /usr/lib/gpgdir directory.
    - Added check_commands() subroutine from psad.
