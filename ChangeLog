    - Added --Include and --Include-from options to allow inclusion
      regular expressions to be specified.
    - Bugfix for not decrypting filesnames that contain spaces.

gpgdir-0.9.2 (01/05/2005):
    - Added preservation of file mtime and atime values (may be disabled
      with the --no-preserve-times option).
    - Added testing encryption and decryption of dummy file (may be
      disabled with --skip-test) by default for both encrypt and decrypt
      modes.
    - Added --test-mode to run encrypt -> decrypt test and exit.
    - Removed unnecessary compression options.
    - Updated get_homedir() to reference HOME environmental variable if
      the /etc/passwd file does not exist (OS X being a good example).
    - Added --verbose mode.
    - Updated output to generate errors on a per-file basis instead of
      dumping them at the end of an encrypt/decrypt operation.

gpgdir-0.9.1 (11/11/2004):
    - Updated GnuPG.pm perl module to handle return code of PLAINTEXT
      which seems to be returned by GunPG now (as of version 1.2.6)
      instead of DECRYPTION_OKAY upon a successful decryption.

gpgdir-0.9 (09/12/2004):
    - Added --gnupg-dir option to allow a user to specify a different
      user's .gnupg directory for encryption keys.

gpgdir-0.8 (05/29/2004):
    - Added --Exclude and --Exclude-from options to allow files to be
      excluded based on regex matches.
    - Reworked error messages so they contain the filename associated
      with each error.

gpgdir-0.4 (04/23/2004):
    - Added --pw-file option so that a decryption password can be
      read out of a file.
    - Better directory validation (filesystem -e and -d checks).
    - Added INSTALL file.
    - Updated man page and README file.

gpgdir-0.3 (09/27/2003):
    - Bundled perl modules GnuPG and TermReadKey with gpgdir.
